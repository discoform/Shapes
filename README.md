Shapes is a simple e-commerce theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/). Best used for small shops with limited inventory.

## Getting Started

__You'll need a [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/) account to use this theme.__ All the development is set up to support adding items to your cart from either the homepage or product page, so you'll simply need to add your Snipcart API to the _config.yml file and create your products.

## Data files

In the `_data` directory you'll find files to handle the following site components and features:

- `siteNavigation.yml` (header navigation and footer navigation)
- `siteSocial.yml` (Social sharing and Social following options)

## Contact Form

A simple HTML contact form with the [Netlify data attribution](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/) is added. This should work out of the box if you're using Netlify for hosting, otherwise you can replace this with your own solution.
